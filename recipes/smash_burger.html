    <h3>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd.</h3>
    <p>Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic Burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>Smash Burger Patties:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 80/20, divided into 8 portions</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Black Pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Garlic Powder</li>
                <li>4 Slices of American Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Burger Sauce:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 tbsp garlic sauce </li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Toppings:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Burger Buns</li>
                <li>Sliced Dill Pickles</li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Divide beef into 8 even portions, about 3 oz each. Loosely Roll them into balls then cover and refrigerate while preparing remaining ingredients. The meat must be cold when it hits the grill.</li>
                <li>Increase griddle to medium/high heat. Place 2-4 burger balls onto hot griddle. Working quickly, place parchment paper over the meat and firmly smash straight down into a thin patty.</li>
                <li>Once patties are smashed, peel back and discard parchment papers and season patties with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Add 1/2 teaspoon of burger sauce. Cook 2 minutes on the first side or until seared and juices start to come to the surface.</li>
                <li>Scrape under the burger with spatula facing down at a 45˚ angle to get under the caramelized part and flip. Cook another 1 minute. Top half of the patties with sliced cheese and cover cheese with the second patty. Repeat with remaining burgers and transfer them to a platter as they finish cooking.</li>
                <li>Place sauce on bottom of bun. Top with 3 pickle slices, shredded lettuce, 2 tomato slices and thin sliced onion. Add double patty and top with bun.</li>
            </ol>
